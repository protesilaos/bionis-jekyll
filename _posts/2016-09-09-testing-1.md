This is a *paragraph*. Do not use <u>text underlining</u> for emphasis on the web. I am just suggesting that this is **important**. That styling usually denotes a link and may, therefore, create confusion. Curious how links look? Here is one to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) just for your info.

A code block:[^Prot16Note]

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/bionis-secondary.css">

<script type="text/javascript">
 {% raw %}{% include main.min.js %}{% endraw %}
</script>
```

## Just a heading 2

Use section headings to demarcate the thematic sections of your text. Do not use any heading tag on the basis of its font size or other features. Bear in mind that your article is also read by machines. It is important to use HTML tags in a semantically correct way.

Enough of that. Here's the quote of the day:[^FootnoteSample]

> The greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when one asked me what I thought, and attended to my answer.

### Just a heading 3

For small text, you may opt for the `<small>` html tag, which will deliver something like this: <small>This is small text in a semantically correct way</small>.

This probably covers it.

[^Prot16Note]: The colour scheme is part of my [Prot16 project](http://www.protesilaos.com/schemes). There is a large number of themes if you are interested, especially for the Atom text editor.

[^FootnoteSample]: The good thing about footnotes is that you can add a comment without worrying that it will disrupt the reader's flow.
