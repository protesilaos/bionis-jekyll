# Bionis: a minimalist template for Jekyll

**This project is still in its testing phase.**

Bionis is the theme used on [my website](http://www.protesilaos.com). The present repository contains a working demo with the basic source code, separated from all the components/modules that are specific to my configuration and needs.

Bionis focuses on content, be it ordinary text or code. It is developed with a mobile-first approach, scaling from the small screen to the desktop where it eventually becomes a two-column design.

The colour scheme consists of a carefully selected palette of 8 base values plus 8 accents. The bases are subdivided into a light and a dark variant. This makes Bionis excellent both for legibility and for highlighting code syntax. The colour scheme is in fact available for other applications, such as the Atom text editor. Learn more about it in its [project page](http://www.protesilaos.com/bionis).

This repo will eventually include guidelines on how to install, configure, and use this template. It will also include a Ruby gem version for sites on Jekyll >= 3.2.
