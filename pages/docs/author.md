Bionis is a minimalist, mobile-first template for Jekyll-powered websites. It features a two-column view on desktop viewports. The colour scheme is a comprehensive 16-value palette that is optimised both for the needs of the webside and for highlighting code syntax.[^BionisLink]

[^BionisLink]: To learn more about the colour scheme, refer to its [project page](http://www.protesilaos.com/bionis).
